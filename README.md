# Unique Grading Calculator: An Engaging Python App with a Splash of Color! 🌈

Looking for a distinctive grading calculator? Your search ends here! Our Python application is not just functional but eye-catching. It's designed to make grading calculations a unique and colorful experience, breaking free from the shackles of mundane interfaces.

## What Makes This App Stand Out?

### 📊 Unique Grading Scale
This app boasts a custom grading scale with distinct colors for each grade, from the regal Purple A+ to the classic Black F. Your grading experience will never be the same.

### 🖥️ User-Friendly Interface
Built with Tkinter, our app is incredibly beginner-friendly. Just input the actual score, the class's highest score, and the class size (total strength). No tech wizardry required!

### 🛡️ Robust Error Handling
We've got your back. The app ensures that you enter valid numbers for actual score, maximum score, and class strength. It checks for non-negative values and handles errors gracefully.

### 📈 Precise Relative Grade Calculation
The app calculates the student's relative grade as a percentage and pairs it with the custom grading scale. The result is displayed in vibrant color. Watch the magic unfold!

### 🎨 Elegant Custom Styling
We've tailored the buttons and input fields to provide a visually pleasing experience. The app's interface is not just functional; it's a work of art. You'll enjoy every click.
